### About this repo
This is the repository of Chevereto Free edition which is forked from Chevereto 3.X series. Chevereto Free has the same look and feel of our [paid version](https://chevereto.com) but it packs only the most essential features and it doesn't include any kind of support. It is Open Source software licensed under the AGPLv3 license.

### Free vs Paid Chevereto
Paid edition includes all features (storages, banners, likes, followers, social login, etc.) and it gets more frequent updates. Free edition is always 6 months behind the paid edition and lots of sacrifices had to be made to be able to offer this free product. The following table summarizes the differences between free/paid editions.

| Facebook, Twitter, Google and VK signup      	| No              	| Yes                    	|

Keep in mind that when you prefer the paid edition you contribute to keep development ongoing. At Chevereto we don't sell any kind of extra paid plugins or offer additional support tiers. We believe in one-time payments and upgrade fees only for major versions. We don't even charge any yearly-based fees.
